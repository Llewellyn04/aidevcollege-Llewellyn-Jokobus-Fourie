# Challenge 3: Use GitHub Actions with Azure Machine Learning for MLOps

Get started with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to train a model on Azure Machine Learning. 

GitHub Actions uses a workflow YAML (.yml) file in the `/.github/workflows/` path in your repository. This definition contains the various steps and parameters that make up the workflow. These steps include **data preparation, model training, testing and scoring**. Please take some time to get familiar with this as well.

**A similar tutorial based on Azure DevOps can be found** [here](day1/MLOps/MLOps.md).


## Prerequisites

For this challenge we will fork an additional repository to make using GitHub Actions easier. Please navigate [here](https://github.com/alschroe/ml-template-azure) and follow the instructions. You will be redirected back to this training afterwards.
