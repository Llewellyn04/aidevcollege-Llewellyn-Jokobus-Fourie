# AI Developer College Day2 - Form Recognizer

Azure Form Recognizer is a cloud-based [Azure Applied AI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/applied-ai-services/?view=form-recog-3.0.0) for developers to build intelligent document processing solutions. Form Recognizer applies machine-learning-based optical character recognition (OCR) and document understanding technologies to extract text, tables, structure, and key-value pairs from documents. You can also label and train custom models to automate data extraction from structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents.
